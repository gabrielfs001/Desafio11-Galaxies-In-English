# Rocketseat challenge
This was the eleventh challenge from @Rocketseat, where i should translate this simple project that we made in the past.


### About the Galaxies Project

This project is a simple HTML/CSS page exercise for begginers. It's about the use of grid, to display cards with images and data about galaxies.
